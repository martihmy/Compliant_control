# The Controllers

The folders "AC", "HFMC" and "VIC" contain the executable scripts, responsible for each compliant force controller.

- Admittance Control (AC)
- Hybrid Force/Motion Control (HFMC)
- Force-based Variable Impedance Control (VIC)

The controllers are implemented based on control laws from literary sources. The sources are documented in Compliant_control/LCRM_Figures/Master_Thesis_LCRM.pdf
