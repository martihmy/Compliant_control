# Compliant Control

This repository is based on justagist's [PandaSimulator](https://github.com/justagist/panda_simulator). The folder Compliant_control contains the work related to my master's thesis "Learning Compliant Robotic Manipulation". In the folder, three compliant force controllers are implemented for the Panda robot: Admittance Control (AC), Hybrid Force/Motion Control (HFMC) and Force-based Variable Impedance Control (VIC). Nrontsis' repository [PILCO](https://github.com/nrontsis/PILCO) provides functionality for the model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithm PILCO. Compliant_control provides compatibility between the PILCO-implementation and the implemented force controllers, constituting a PILCO-framework for learning control-strategies.
